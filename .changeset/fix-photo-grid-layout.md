Fix photo grid responsive layout to show single column on mobile screens

The photo grid now properly displays a single column on narrow screens (< 768px) instead of showing 2 columns, providing better mobile user experience with full-width images. Updated responsive breakpoints: 1 column on mobile, 2 columns on medium screens, 3 columns on large screens, and 4 columns on extra large screens.
