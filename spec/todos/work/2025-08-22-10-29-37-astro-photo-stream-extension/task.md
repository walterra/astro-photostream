## Original Todo

Investigate: I want the photo stream functionality of this blog to be published as an open source astrojs extensions. Research 2025 best practice. Does astrojs have a plugin system that can be used? How do I market it once public to make it popular?

## Description

Extract and modularize the proven photo stream functionality from the reference implementation at `/Users/walterra/dev/walterra-dev` (Cactus theme) into a standalone, theme-independent Astro integration.

**Reference Implementation Analysis**: The working photo stream system includes:

- Content collection-based architecture with metadata schema
- AI metadata generation using Claude API
- EXIF extraction using exifr for camera settings, GPS, timestamps
- Geolocation with OpenCage API reverse geocoding and privacy controls
- Interactive maps (single & multi-marker) with location consolidation
- Responsive grids (2/3/4 columns) with hover effects and lazy loading
- Pagination with keyboard navigation and SEO optimization
- Automated photo workflow: upload â†’ EXIF extraction â†’ AI analysis â†’ content generation

**Goal**: Create a theme-independent integration that provides the same functionality but works with any Astro site, not just the Cactus theme. The package must extract proven patterns while removing Cactus-specific dependencies.
