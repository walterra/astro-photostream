## Original Todo

Investigate: I want the photo stream functionality of this blog to be published as an open source astrojs extensions. Research 2025 best practice. Does astrojs have a plugin system that can be used? How do I market it once public to make it popular?

## Description

Extract and modularize the proven photo stream functionality from the reference implementation at `/Users/walterra/dev/walterra-dev` (Cactus theme) into a standalone, theme-independent Astro integration.

**Reference Implementation Analysis**: The working photo stream system includes:
- Content collection-based architecture with comprehensive metadata schema
- AI-powered metadata generation using Claude API with personality injection
- EXIF extraction using exifr for camera settings, GPS, timestamps
- Smart geolocation with OpenCage API reverse geocoding and privacy controls
- Interactive maps (single & multi-marker) with intelligent location consolidation
- Responsive grids (2/3/4 columns) with hover effects and lazy loading
- Pagination with keyboard navigation and SEO optimization
- Automated photo workflow: upload → EXIF extraction → AI analysis → content generation

**Goal**: Create a theme-independent integration that provides the same sophisticated functionality but works with any Astro site, not just the Cactus theme. The package must extract proven patterns while removing Cactus-specific dependencies.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Integration Setup
- [ ] Create new npm package structure with Astro integration API
- [ ] Extract core components (PhotoCard, PhotoGrid, PhotoStream, MultiMarkerMap)
- [ ] Set up content collection schema for photos with EXIF metadata
- [ ] Configure package.json with proper Astro integration keywords and peerDependencies

### Phase 2: Modularize Metadata Generation
- [ ] Extract metadata generator functions from existing script (src/scripts/photo-metadata-generator.ts)
- [ ] Create modular classes: PhotoMetadataGenerator, ExifProcessor, LLMAnalyzer, GeocodeProcessor
- [ ] Add CLI commands for metadata generation and batch processing
- [ ] Implement configuration system with API keys and customizable options

### Phase 3: Page Templates & Routing
- [ ] Extract page templates ([...page].astro, [slug].astro, tags/[tag]/[...page].astro)
- [ ] Create route injection system through Astro integration hooks
- [ ] Implement pagination and navigation functionality
- [ ] Add OpenGraph image generation endpoints

### Phase 4: Documentation & Examples
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with installation and configuration
- [ ] Build demo site showcasing all features
- [ ] Write API documentation with TypeScript types
- [ ] Create video tutorial demonstrating setup and usage

### Phase 5: Marketing & Distribution
- [ ] Submit to Astro integrations directory (astro.build/integrations)
- [ ] Create blog post explaining the integration and its benefits
- [ ] Share in Astro Discord #showcase channel
- [ ] Write technical articles about photo metadata automation

### User Testing Steps
- [ ] Test integration installation via `npx astro add`
- [ ] Verify photo collection setup and content generation
- [ ] Test metadata generation with sample photos
- [ ] Validate responsive grid layouts and navigation
- [ ] Confirm OpenGraph image generation works

## Success Criteria

**CRITICAL**: Define measurable outcomes that validate task completion. Every implementation must satisfy ALL criteria before marking task as complete.
