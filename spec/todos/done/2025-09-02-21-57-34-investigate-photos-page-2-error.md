## Description

The error occurs because Astro's route injection prioritizes the `/photos/[slug]` route over `/photos/[...page]`, causing pagination URLs like `/photos/2` to be incorrectly interpreted as photo slug requests. The route resolver looks for a photo with slug="2" which doesn't exist, triggering the "Missing parameter: slug" error.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Functional: `/photos/2` correctly displays page 2 of photo pagination
- [x] Functional: `/photos/1` correctly displays page 1 of photo pagination
- [x] Functional: Individual photo pages (e.g., `/photos/actual-photo-slug`) still work correctly
- [x] Quality: No TypeScript compilation errors after route injection fix
- [x] User validation: Playwright MCP screenshot confirms `/photos/2` renders photo grid (not error)
- [x] Visual verification: Screenshot shows expected pagination layout with photos

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Use Playwright MCP to screenshot current error at `/photos/2`
- [x] Examine route injection order in `src/index.ts`
- [x] Fix route injection by reordering or using more specific patterns
- [x] Test pagination routes `/photos`, `/photos/2`, `/photos/3`
- [x] Test individual photo routes still work
- [x] User test: Manual navigation through pagination
- [x] Visual test: Screenshot verification of working pagination

## Original Todo

i installed astro-photostream 0.3.1 in ~/dev/walterra-dev - the photo index page is now correctly picking up the wrapping page style. unfortunately photo page 2 is failing with an error: TypeError
An error occurred.
Missing parameter: slug
manifest/generator.js:17:13 - investigate using playwright mcp (including screenshot) at http://localhost:4321/photos/2 (walterra-dev dev server already running)
