## Original Todo

- check http://localhost:4322/photos - the photo grid layout looks broken, fix it.

## Description

The photo grid layout at http://localhost:4322/photos was displaying photos with inconsistent heights and gaps, not matching the clean reference implementation in walterra-dev.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Functional: Photo grid displays images in clean, uniform grid
- [x] Functional: Photos use consistent aspect ratios (square for 4-column layout)
- [x] Functional: Grid matches reference implementation styling
- [x] Functional: Images are properly zoom-cropped to perfect squares using fit:cover
- [x] Functional: Responsive breakpoints work correctly (single column on narrow screens should be full width)
- [x] Visual: Images have rounded corners like reference implementation
- [x] Quality: Uses simple Tailwind classes instead of complex CSS Grid
- [x] User validation: Visual comparison confirms layout matches reference

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Compare current implementation with reference in walterra-dev
- [x] Replace complex CSS Grid masonry approach with simple Tailwind grid
- [x] Update PhotoGrid to use reference implementation pattern
- [x] Fix image cropping using getImage with fit:cover parameter
- [x] Clean up PhotoCard component code (remove unnecessary null initialization)
- [x] Improve responsive breakpoint triggers for better mobile experience
- [x] Add rounded corners to images to match reference styling
- [x] Test grid layout matches reference visual appearance

## Review

- [x] Grid displays in proper uniform columns with consistent spacing
- [x] Aspect ratios are enforced correctly with proper zoom-crop (square thumbnails)
- [x] Images are perfectly cropped to 300x300 squares using Astro's image optimization
- [x] Layout uses clean Tailwind grid classes
- [x] Responsive behavior confirmed working (single column on narrow screens displays full-width images)
- [x] Images have rounded corners matching reference implementation (rounded-lg applied)

## Notes

Progress made:

1. Simplified PhotoGrid component to match reference implementation
2. Used Tailwind grid classes: `grid gap-4 grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4`
3. Fixed image cropping with getImage({ fit: 'cover' }) for perfect square thumbnails
4. All images now properly zoom-crop to 300x300 instead of letterboxing
5. Cleaned up PhotoCard component code

Final verification complete:

- ✅ Responsive breakpoints verified: Single column displays full-width images on 375px screens
- ✅ Rounded corners confirmed: `rounded-lg` class properly applied in PhotoCard component
- ✅ All success criteria met and functionality working as expected
