## Original Todo

- create a basic first CI check

## Description

Create a basic CI workflow that runs automated quality checks on pull requests and pushes to prevent bad code from being merged.

**Current State Analysis:**

- Project has release automation (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) but no quality gate workflow
- Strong local enforcement via Husky v9 (pre-commit: lint-staged, commit-msg: commitlint)
- Comprehensive quality scripts available: `pnpm quality` (lint + format:check + astro check)
- Tests and CLI build commands exist but not enforced in CI
- Node engines require >=18.0.0

**What This Task Will Create:**
A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs on PRs and pushes to main, executing:

1. Full codebase linting (`pnpm lint`)
2. Format validation (`pnpm format:check`)
3. Astro type checking (`pnpm check`)
4. CLI TypeScript compilation (`pnpm build:cli`)
5. Test suite (`pnpm test`)
6. Node version matrix testing (18.x, 20.x)
7. CI status badge in README.md

**Why This Matters:**

- Pre-commit hooks only check staged files; CI checks entire codebase
- Prevents merge of code that passes local hooks but breaks project-wide
- Validates integration works across supported Node versions
- Establishes quality gate before code reaches main branch

## Success Criteria

- [x] Functional: CI workflow file created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with all quality checks configured
- [x] Functional: Workflow executes `pnpm quality` and `pnpm build:cli` successfully (tests excluded as they don't exist yet)
- [x] Functional: Node version matrix (18.x, 20.x) both complete without errors
- [x] Functional: Workflow uses pnpm 10.9.0 and triggers on pull_request and push to main
- [x] User validation: Manual test confirms workflow runs and passes all checks

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Code change: Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with quality check job configuration (.github/workflows/ci.yml:1-48)
- [x] Code change: Configure job matrix for Node 18.x and 20.x testing (.github/workflows/ci.yml:19-21)
- [x] Code change: Add pnpm setup (version 10.9.0) and dependency installation steps (.github/workflows/ci.yml:31-37)
- [x] Code change: Add quality check steps (pnpm quality, pnpm build:cli) - tests commented out as they don't exist yet (.github/workflows/ci.yml:39-47)
- [x] Code change: Configure workflow triggers (pull_request, push to main) with concurrency controls (.github/workflows/ci.yml:3-13)
- [x] Code change: Add CI status badge to README.md showing main branch build status (README.md:4)
- [x] Automated test: Run `pnpm quality` locally to verify all checks pass
- [x] Automated test: Run `pnpm build:cli` locally to verify CLI builds
- [x] User test: Create test branch, push changes, and verify workflow executes in GitHub Actions
- [x] User test: Confirm all matrix jobs (Node 18.x and 20.x) complete successfully
- [x] User test: Verify CI badge in README.md displays correct status after workflow runs

## Review

**Code Quality Assessment:**

Reviewed `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `README.md`, and all modified files:

✓ **Workflow Structure:** Follows GitHub Actions best practices

- Uses latest action versions (@v4)
- Implements concurrency controls to prevent redundant builds
- Uses `--frozen-lockfile` for deterministic dependency installation

✓ **Node Version Matrix:** Correctly configured for project requirements

- Tests on both minimum supported (18.x) and current LTS (20.x)
- Aligns with package.json engines specification

✓ **Quality Checks:** Comprehensive coverage

- Linting, formatting, type checking via `pnpm quality`
- CLI build verification ensures TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Test step properly documented and ready to enable when tests are added

✓ **Badge Implementation:** Correctly configured

- Points to correct workflow and branch
- Positioned appropriately in README.md

✓ **User Testing:** All success criteria verified in live environment

**No bugs, edge cases, or code quality issues identified.**

## Notes

**Implementation Adjustments:**

1. **Test Step Removed:** The `pnpm test` step was removed from the CI workflow because no test files exist yet. This is documented in the workflow with a TODO comment pointing to the separate todo item "Implement comprehensive test suite". The test step is commented out and ready to be enabled when tests are added.

2. **Formatting Fix:** Fixed code formatting in `src/styles/aps-core.css` using `pnpm format` to ensure format:check passes.

3. **Local Validation:** All quality checks passed locally:
   - `pnpm quality` completed successfully (lint + format:check + astro check)
   - `pnpm build:cli` compiled successfully
   - ESLint warnings about `any` types are acceptable (14 warnings, 0 errors)

**Files Modified:**

- Created: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI workflow with Node 18.x/20.x matrix
- Updated: `README.md:4` - Added CI status badge
- Formatted: `src/styles/aps-core.css` - Fixed Prettier formatting

**Ready for User Testing:** The CI workflow is complete and ready to test by pushing to GitHub.

**User Testing Complete:**

User pushed changes to GitHub and confirmed:

- ✓ CI workflow executed successfully on GitHub Actions
- ✓ Both Node.js matrix jobs (18.x and 20.x) passed all checks
- ✓ Quality checks (`pnpm quality`) passed
- ✓ CLI build (`pnpm build:cli`) succeeded
- ✓ CI badge displays correctly in README.md

**All success criteria met.**
